GeeksforGeeks brings back Three 90 Challenge!,1.6M views,3 weeks ago,264,"Start the Three 90 Challenge today: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/courses

When we started the #Three90 challenge in January, we never realized that we would receive so much love from you guys for this initiative. Since then, I have seen thousands of students taking up the challenge, completing the courses, and earning their refunds.

Our intent behind this challenge was to ensure that students who enroll, complete their courses so that they can maximize their potential. And I am happy to share that our average course completion rate has gone up to 85% since this challenge started.

With over INR 1 CR+ refunded so far in the first 6 months, and to ensure that you remain motivated in the last 6 months of 2024, we are happy to re-introduce the Three 90 Challenge for all of you who missed it the first time around. 

So wait no more, and take up the challenge today!

What is Dynamic Programming? |  Data Structures & Algorithms | GeeksforGeeks,840 views,4 weeks ago,24,"Welcome to the next video of our DSA Course, where we dive into the concept of DYNAMIC PROGRAMMING.

In this video, We'll break down how DP stores solutions to subproblems to avoid redundant calculations.

We will solve classic DP problems like Fibonacci Sequence and Longest Common Subsequence, with clear 
explanations. Learn how to recognize situations where DP can be applied to optimize your code.

Explore different DP approaches (top-down vs. bottom-up) and choose the best fit for your problem. And discover how DP is used in various coding scenarios, from bioinformatics to text editing.

Face Detection using Python and OpenCV with webcam | Python Projects | GeeksforGeeks,5.2K views,8 months ago,125,"In this Project, we will see how to develop real-time human face detection in Python using OpenCV. The objective of the program given is to detect objects of interest(faces) in real-time and to keep track of the same object. Face Recognition is a part of computer vision where we locate and visualize faces using ML models in any digital image. 
OpenCV contains many pre-trained classifiers for face, eyes, smiles, etc. Face detection using Haar cascades files is a machine-learning approach where the model is trained with a set of input data. 

You need to download the trained classifier haarcascade_frontalface_default.xml from here: https://github.com/opencv/opencv/tree... 
which is available in OpenCv’s GitHub repository.

Bi-Wizard School Coding Contest | GeeksforGeeks School,2.5K views,2 years ago,87,"Coding is the most in-demand and upcoming skill of the industry and it will continue to grow as the years pass. Despite all this, students often restrict themselves from getting started with coding, and not only students, but the parents are also not very much active in encouraging their wards to learn to code.  

And we believe now is the time to break this stigma around this conversation and to promote coding culture among students and create genuine interest & curiosity in them to get started with coding. Keeping this in mind, GeeksforGeeks is coming up with an exciting coding tournament exclusively for school students!

Tips For System Design Interview | Yogita Sharma | GeeksforGeeks,2.5K views,3 years ago,105,"You need to know that System Design Interviews are not like Coding Interviews where there are one or two definite solutions for the given problem - instead System Design Interviews are the subjective ones and there can be so many solutions for a particular problem depending on how you approach the problem, how you'll apply your knowledge to actually build a system, etc. And this is why cracking System Design interviews is not an easy-to-go task. 

But, to make things a bit easier for you, here we have an expert Yogita Sharma with us who is currently working as an SDE II at Careem (Uber) - she will tell you some most worthwhile and effective tips that will surely help you to ace in your upcoming System Design Interviews.
