This project demonstrates how to perform web scraping using Python libraries like **BeautifulSoup** and **requests**. It includes examples of extracting data from static websites and structuring it for analysis or storage.

## Features

- Scrapes HTML content from target websites
- Parses and extracts specific data elements (e.g., titles, prices, links)
- Handles HTTP requests and responses
- Cleanly organizes scraped data into structured formats (like CSV or JSON)
- Includes error handling for common issues (timeouts, missing elements)

## Technologies Used

- Python 3
- BeautifulSoup (bs4)
- requests
- pandas (for saving/processing scraped data)
